          Welcome to the Panel of your Kirby demo! Here you can find several examples for you to explore and play around.

          Each example stands for a different type of site with completely different Panel setups.

          We tried to make them feel as real as possible and give you a nice set of placeholder data to experiment with.

          Every aspect of the Panel interface can be customized with our blueprints and plugins. You can find out more about all the possibilities in our **(link: https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/blueprints/introduction text: docs)**.

          The Panel setup cannot be changed in the Panel though. If you want to play around with blueprints and templates, you should install the **(link: https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit text: Starterkit)** on your own machine.
